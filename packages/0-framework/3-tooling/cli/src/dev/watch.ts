/**
 * Local-dev spec § 6 `watch.ts`: watches each assembled bundle's declared
 * `watch` paths (a directory watched recursively, a file watched plainly),
 * debounced 300 ms and coalesced across every service — one edit across
 * several files/services still fires exactly one rebuild.
 *
 * The watch ENGINE is `chokidar` v4 (operator decision, design tip 74272d8:
 * don't-reinvent-the-wheel beats the no-new-deps contract here — chokidar
 * absorbs the atomic-rename/inode-swap class this module used to hand-fix
 * with a parent-directory workaround, plus the cross-platform
 * recursive-watch differences; v4 is pure JS, no native code, no glob
 * surface — irrelevant here anyway, since every target is a literal file or
 * directory path, never a pattern). The debounce stays OURS: chokidar's own
 * `awaitWriteFinish` is a per-file "has this file's size stopped changing"
 * poll, a different semantic from "coalesce a burst across many files into
 * one callback," which is what the dev loop actually needs.
