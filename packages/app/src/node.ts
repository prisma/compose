/**
 * Core model: node types and the factories that construct them. All nodes are
 * frozen instances of a small class hierarchy — with two sanctioned behavior
 * slots beyond deploy-time loading: a Connection's `hydrate` (validated
 * values → client) and, on the target pack's runnable service subclass,
 * `run`/`load` (the process controller and its pull-DI). The Service node
 * carries NO handler — it is a description; the code that serves is the
 * app's own entrypoint. Config declarations are pure data; core reads no
 * environment. A node's `type` is its routing key at deploy; core never
 * interprets it beyond lookup.
 *
 * Deploy-only module loading (target packs' `/target`, build adapters'
 * `/assemble`) is NODE-OWNED: a pack factory bakes a full, author-written
 * module specifier onto the node/adapter as data (`targetModule`,
 * `BuildAdapter.assembler`), and the node's own methods (`loadTarget()`,
 * `loadAssembler()`, `assemble()`) perform the dynamic import. Core never
 * constructs a specifier from a pack name and a subpath, never anchors
 * resolution at an entry file, and never uses `createRequire`/
 * `require.resolve` — the specifier is already the whole thing an author
 * wrote, and node's own resolver (walking node_modules up from the file that
 * calls `import()`) does the rest, exactly like any other bare specifier.
 *
 * The firewall this depends on: every `import()` call below takes its
 * specifier from a variable or property access — `this.targetModule`,
 * `this.build.assembler` — NEVER a static string literal. A pack's authoring
 * module (the file that calls `service()`/`compute()`/etc.) gets bundled
 * INTO the production wrapper by each assembler's own build (which inlines
 * `@prisma/app*`), and bundlers only follow an `import()` whose argument is a
 * literal they can see at build time. A literal `import('@prisma/app-node/
 * assemble')` anywhere reachable from an authoring module would get followed
 * and dragged into the runtime artifact; keeping the specifier as data and
 * the import's argument a property read keeps it invisible to the bundler,
 * while still being a completely ordinary dynamic import at the moment
 * deploy tooling actually calls these methods (which is never at runtime).
