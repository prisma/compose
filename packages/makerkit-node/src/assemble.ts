/**
 * Deploy-only (ADR-0005): the user's own build produces the app's runnable;
 * this assembles MakerKit's deploy artifact from it. Validates the built
 * entry exists, bundles the service module (the MakerKit wrapper) to its own
 * output, then copies the app's entry in beside it.
 *
 * Two SEPARATE builds, not one multi-entry build: a single build would
 * dedupe the shared service module into a chunk both entries import — one
 * module instance. run() (the wrapper) and load() (the app entry) must be
 * independent instances that hand off through process.env, so the wrapper
 * gets its own self-contained build and the app's already-built entry is
 * copied in untouched. @makerkit/* is inlined (node_modules isn't shipped);
 * `bun` is a Compute runtime built-in.
 *
 * All paths are file-relative (ADR-0004): `build.entry` resolves against
 * `dirname(build.module)`, never against a discovered package directory.
