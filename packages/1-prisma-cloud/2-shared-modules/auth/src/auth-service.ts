/**
 * The auth compute service (spec § Service): the pack-carrying `db`
 * dependency, the platform-minted instance `secret` slot, the public
 * `baseUrl` param (the consumer app's origin — what browsers see and
 * `trustedOrigins` allows), and the three exposed ports backed by one
 * process. Build/entry mechanics copied from email's service file:
 * `build.module` points at this file's own built output so the deploy
 * bootstrap can re-import it as `main`; `entry` resolves the sibling
 * entrypoint pass in the same dist directory.
