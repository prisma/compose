# The deploy CLI (`prisma-app`)

The Prisma App Framework's own deploy entrypoint: what the `prisma-app`
command does, the contracts it introduces, and what stays out of its scope.
The decisions it
rests on are recorded in
[ADR-0003](../90-decisions/ADR-0003-deploy-derives-everything-from-the-root-node.md)
(no config file, everything derived from the root node),
[ADR-0004](../90-decisions/ADR-0004-paths-resolve-relative-to-the-authoring-file.md)
(every path is relative to the file that writes it),
[ADR-0005](../90-decisions/ADR-0005-users-build-the-framework-assembles.md)
(users build, the framework assembles),
[ADR-0006](../90-decisions/ADR-0006-every-node-is-named.md) (node names; the
root's name names the application),
[ADR-0007](../90-decisions/ADR-0007-deploy-drives-alchemy-through-a-generated-stack-file.md)
(the generated stack file), and
[ADR-0008](../90-decisions/ADR-0008-wrapper-inlines-everything-except-runtime-builtins.md)
(wrapper inlining).

## Scope

Two commands:

- **`prisma-app deploy <entry>`** — deploy the application whose root node is
  `entry`'s default export.
- **`prisma-app destroy <entry>`** — tear it down (same derivation, Alchemy
  destroy).

Flags: `--name` (override the root's name — per-run ephemeral deploys in
shared workspaces), `--stage`. Nothing else. `prisma-app build`, `prisma-app
dev`, and topology emission are out of scope (see § Out of scope).

**Runtime.** The bin is runtime-agnostic — no bun-only APIs anywhere in the
CLI or assembly code — so it runs under both bun and node (≥ 22.18, where
type stripping imports the user's `.ts` entry natively). One inherent caveat:
an app whose service module imports bun APIs can only deploy under bun, since
loading the graph imports that module — the app's choice, not a CLI limit.

## The pipeline

`prisma-app deploy` is one pass from a module path to a driven Alchemy stack:

1. **Import the entry module.** Its default export must be a node (service or
   System). No marked root exists in the model — whatever you point the CLI at
   *is* the application, and the graph reachable from it is what deploys.
2. **Load.** Core's `Load` walks the graph. A service with an unwired
   dependency slot (one an enclosing System normally wires to a provisioned
   producer) fails here, with an error naming the input and pointing at the
   composing System. The deploy root must be a System — a bare service is not
   independently deployable; the CLI errors naming the fix (wrap it:
   `system('name', (h) => h.provision(...))`).
3. **Infer the target.** Collect the distinct target-module specifier each
   pack-authored node carries (`targetModule`). Exactly one must appear (mixed
   targets → error). Ask a node carrying it to load its own target —
   `node.loadTarget()` dynamically imports the specifier (ADR-0016); the CLI
   constructs no specifier and resolves no path — then call the module's
   `fromEnv()` export, which reads its own environment variables and errors
   naming any missing one. Inference can't silently pick wrong: `lower()`
   routes every node type through the target's tables, and a mismatch is a
   `LowerError` naming the unknown type.
4. **Resolve the name.** The root node's name (every node is named — ADR-0006),
   unless `--name` overrides it — CI's per-run ephemeral deploys use this so a
   name never collides with a standing demo.
5. **Assemble each service.** Ask each service node to assemble itself —
   `node.assemble()` loads the build adapter's own assembler (ADR-0016) and
   calls it. The assembler resolves its `entry` (and any other path field)
   relative to `dirname(build.module)` — the authoring module the descriptor
   carries (ADR-0004) — no directory discovery of any kind. Assembly validates
   the user's built output exists (missing → "run your build" error; staleness
   is not detected) and produces a normalized bundle `{ dir, entry }`.
6. **Lower and drive.** Write the pipeline's results as a runnable stack
   module at `.prisma-app/alchemy.run.ts` and drive the `alchemy` CLI against
   it (ADR-0007). The generated file and Alchemy's state live in the
   process's working directory — tool state lives where you run the tool,
   like any other CLI (ADR-0004).

The pass that assembles a service is the same pass that lowers it, so the
correlation between services and their built bundles never exists as
user-facing configuration — it is computed, written into the generated stack
file, and consumed in one motion.

## Build ownership

Per ADR-0005, the CLI initiates no user builds. The contract is that built
output exists first — `turbo run build && prisma-app deploy`, or whatever the
user's tooling does. Assembly *consumes* that output and applies the
framework's envelope:

- **The wrapper** (all kinds): the service module bundled to `main.mjs` with a
  fixed, internal bundler invocation — the framework's boot protocol, never
  exposed to users, never part of their build.
- **Framework normalization** (per kind): e.g. making a Next standalone tree
  self-contained (hoisted `node_modules`, static assets, `public/`, the
  runtime-autoinstall guard). Deterministic file-shuffling, not compilation.

The target pack's `package()` then wraps the assembled dir in the target
envelope (bootstrap, manifest, deterministic tar), unchanged from the current
model.

## Contracts this introduces

Two new seams, both symmetric — a node carries the full module specifier of
its deploy-only module as data and loads it itself (ADR-0016), with zero CLI
changes for a new pack or adapter:

- **Pack CLI seam.** Every pack-authored node carries its target's specifier
  (`targetModule`) and loads it via `node.loadTarget()`; the pack's `/target`
  entry exports `fromEnv(): Target`. This is how a community pack becomes
  deployable with zero CLI changes.
- **Assembler seam.** The build adapter *descriptor* stays pure data on the
  node (`{ kind, assembler, module, entry }` — where the user's build puts its
  output, never how to produce it; `entry` and any kind-specific path resolve
  relative to `dirname(module)`). `assembler` is the full specifier of the
  adapter's own `/assemble` module, baked in by its factory (`node()` →
  `"@prisma/app-node/assemble"`, `nextjs()` → `"@prisma/app-nextjs/assemble"`).
  `node.assemble()` loads it via a variable-argument `import` (ADR-0016), so a
  community build adapter works with zero changes anywhere and the heavy
  assembler never leaks into the runtime wrapper. `kind` stays the descriptor's
  own discriminant; the loaded `/assemble` module validates it matches. The
  heavy assembly module never ships in a bundle. Its contract
  is `assemble({ build: descriptor }) → { dir, entry }`
  (`@prisma/app/deploy`'s `AssembleInput`/`Bundle` — defined once there,
  imported by every adapter and by `@prisma/app-assemble` itself).
- **`@prisma/app-assemble`** owns the orchestration this seam drives: routing
  every service node in the loaded graph to its adapter's `/assemble` entry
  (one bundle per provision id — the root is always a System) and the
  wrapper-inlining policy. The CLI is its first consumer; the future
  programmatic deploy API is its second — so its public surface carries no CLI
  concepts (no `CliError`, no argv/usage anything). It throws its own
  `AssembleError`; the CLI's `main.ts` maps it (the existing destroy-path
  wrapping already does, since `AssembleError extends Error`).

## Error surface

The CLI's quality lives in its errors; each failure names its fix:

| Failure | Error tells the user |
| --- | --- |
| Default export isn't a node | what the entry module must export |
| Deploy root isn't a System | to wrap the service in a System |
| Unwired dependency slot | which input, and to deploy the composing System |
| Mixed targets in one graph | the target specifiers found; one target per application |
| Missing target env | the exact variable(s) `fromEnv()` needed |
| Built output missing | the expected path, and "run your build" |
| Unresolvable target/assembler module | the specifier, and to add/check the dependency on that package (node-owned load — ADR-0016) |

## Out of scope (designed around)

- **`prisma-app build`** — and with it any build-command convention or override.
- **`prisma-app dev`** — the local loop.
- **Topology emission** — the serialized-topology artifact for agents/tooling;
  when it lands it must strip the machine-specific `build.module` (ADR-0004).
- **Config-file escape hatch** — a `prisma-app.config.ts` may exist one day as
  the *optional* override for multi-target or heavily parameterized setups;
  never the standard path.
- **Freshness checks** — detecting stale (not just missing) built output.
- **Entry discovery** — the entry path is required; bare invocation errors
  with usage. A discovery convention (e.g. a `package.json` field) would be
  additive.

## CLI behavior notes

- `destroy` warns when `<cwd>/.alchemy` is missing or empty before invoking
  alchemy — the likely causes (wrong directory, nothing ever deployed) mean
  "nothing to do here", not an error; the warning makes the wrong-directory
  case visible instead of silently succeeding (see ADR-0004's state rule).
- `--stage` passes through to the `alchemy` invocation, which owns stage
  semantics; the generated stack file carries no stage (ADR-0007).

## Known limitations

- **`destroy` requires built artifacts.** `prisma-app destroy` evaluates the
  same stack program as deploy, and the pack's `package()` reads the
  assembled bundle — so the app must build before it can be torn down. The
  destroy-path error says exactly that. Whether Alchemy's destroy can run
  against placeholder bundles (skipping assembly) is an open follow-up; it
  needs a live-credential experiment.
- **Native addons don't survive wrapper inlining.** A service module
  importing a package with native bindings (`.node` files — better-sqlite3,
  sharp, …) gets its JS inlined but not the binary, failing at boot rather
  than at assemble. Detecting addon-bearing deps and failing loudly at
  assemble is a follow-up; until then, keep client factories to pure-JS
  drivers (or bun built-ins, which stay external).
